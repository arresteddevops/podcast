Outline/Questions
-----------------
Initial thought based on this comment from Lanette: 
"I'd love to share with dev ops folks & Devs WHY they should care about testing. Basically, it will free them up to better fix a bug once and for good, and it will also mean fewer bugs for them to worry about."

* In your opinion, how do you define testing? What's a unit test vs. functional vs. nonfunctional testing?
* So it's Dev and Ops...where does QA fit? Why not DevQAOps?
* Who should write unit tests? Is this the kind of thing that needs to be strict?
* How do you make sure you've got the right coverage?
* What skills/talents do testers/QA people need to work in a DevOps culture?
* "SOAP web service testing can be a pain because SoapUI is a pain. Are there better tools out there?" - @mattshelton
